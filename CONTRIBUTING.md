# How to contribute

We don't have guidelines for contributing just yet, so it's going to be a bit of a wild ride at first.
But don't worry, we'll figure it out together. For now, just fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
We'll work together to make Backslash the best it can be. And if you have any questions or just want to chat about Backslash,
feel free to join the [Backslash Discord server](https://discord.gg/sTzwBzDkK9). We can't wait to see what you do!
