## Introduction

Welcome to **Backslash** – the Linux-only, open-source alternative to Raycast that you didn’t know you needed, and maybe you still don’t. But hey, you’re here, so let’s roll with it.

If you're tired of seeing shiny, sleek apps for macOS while us Linux users eat crumbs from the tech table, well, here’s Backslash. It’s like Raycast’s weird, estranged uncle who wasn’t invited to the fancy family dinners, but showed up anyway. And guess what? We're doing it _our_ way.

Sure, Raycast is slick, smooth, and sophisticated. But Backslash? Backslash has **character**. So get comfortable and give it a shot — because Linux users deserve nice things too (even if it’s held together by shell scripts and pure spite).

## Features

Backslash has everything you need, and maybe some things you don’t, but hey, we’re here to impress:

- **Search Everything**: Quickly search through your apps, settings, and more. No more aimlessly clicking through directories like you're playing Minesweeper.
- **Custom Commands**: Make your own commands and feel like a hacker in a 90s movie. It's all just a terminal at the end of the day, right?
- **Snappy and Lightweight**: Just like Linux users like it. No bloat here. Raycast who?
- **Integration-friendly**: Plug in your favorite Linux utilities and scripts. It won’t complain, promise.
- **Keyboard-centric**: Mouse? We barely knew her. Navigate everything with your trusty keyboard like the Linux power user you are.

## Installation

It's simple, really. Even your distro-hopping soul can handle this.

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/stevenpersia/backslash/releases).

And just like that, you’re the proud user of Backslash.

## Usage

Once installed, summon the great **Backslash** with a simple keystroke (control + space), and start typing away! You’ll feel like the Linux wizard you were always meant to be.

Need a command? It’s right there.  
Need to open an app? Done.  
Need to remind yourself why you're using Linux and not macOS? Backslash will _not_ help you there. That’s between you and your life choices.

## No Commands? No Problem!

It's time to add some plugins. Just go to our [plugins repo](https://github.com/backslash-app/plugins), find some code that tickles your fancy, and copy it into a folder of your choosing. It's like grocery shopping, but for nerds.

Once you've got your digital goodies, fire up Backslash and click on that lonely button on the right (Don't worry, it's the only button there. Even a sleep-deprived developer couldn't mess this up).

Then, simply point Backslash to your new plugin folder. Voila! You've just transformed your Backslash from a blank slate into a powerhouse of productivity (or procrastination, we don't judge).

> [!WARNING] 
> Remember, this folder must contain plugins only. We know your dog is adorable and your grandma's birthday bash was epic, but please, keep those photo folders on your personal drive. This is a strict no-pet-pics, no-family-reunion-snapshots zone. We want to see your code, not your Corgi (no matter how cute they are in that programmer's hat). Stick to plugins, and let's keep this digital space as organized as we all pretend our actual desktops are. Your future self, digging through this repo at 3 AM, will thank you.__


## FAQ

### **Q: Will Backslash be available for macOS or Windows?**  
**A:** Hahaha… You're funny. No, it won't. And here’s why: **Linux users deserve nice things too, and we’re tired of sharing.** You see, there are far too many gorgeous, well-polished apps that come out for macOS first, sometimes _maybe_ Windows, but they never give us a second thought. Well, Backslash is here for **us**, and we're keeping it that way.  
So if you want your pretty little `.App` file, feel free to check out Raycast, and leave us to our grumbling and bash scripting. No hard feelings. _Kiss, kiss._

### **Q: Is Backslash stable?**  
**A:** Ah, stability... It's like asking if your cat will puke on your keyboard (it will). Backslash is currently in **ALPHA**, so, you know, it's stable for a cat that's still learning to walk. But hey, Linux users are known for their love of adventure and for living life on the edge, right? So, buckle up, and join the ride! (Or, you know, just wait until it's not in alpha anymore.)

### **Q: Can I customize Backslash?**  
**A:** Of course you can! This is **Linux**. Customization is our birthright. You can add commands, integrate your own scripts, and more. If you break something, that's just part of the fun. Just checkout our amazing [documentation](https://github.com/stevenpersia/backslash/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md).

### **Q: Why do you hate Raycast and Mac users?**
**A:** Oh, we don’t hate Raycast at all! In fact, we're huge admirers of their work—that’s precisely why we made a Linux version. Deep down, we know we’re not bringing Backslash to macOS because, well, we’d feel a bit ridiculous next to the real deal.

As for Mac users... Look, we don’t hate you either. It’s just that we, Linux folks, enjoy the challenge of wrestling with open-source, and there’s a special joy in knowing half our hardware only works if we stare at it hard enough. No hard feelings!

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome! We don't have guidelines for contributing just yet, so it's going to be a bit of a wild ride at first. But don't worry, we'll figure it out together. For now, just fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a pull request. We'll work together to make Backslash the best it can be.
